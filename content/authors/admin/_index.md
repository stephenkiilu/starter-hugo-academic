S﻿tephen Kiilu is a machine learning researcher. I am a second-year master's student pursuing the [African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI 2022)](https://aimsammi.org/) at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Senegal. AMMI is a novel, fully funded, intensive graduate program in machine learning and its applications, sponsored by Google and Meta. Prior to joining the AMMI program, I graduated with an M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from AIMS Rwanda in 2021. My background is in statistics, and I hold a B.Sc. in Applied Statistics with IT from Maseno University with first-class honors.

My primary research interest is in machine learning. Within machine learning, I’m generally interested in the intersection of NLP and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in exploring topics in NLP like language models, multilingual models, and low-resource NLP.
